# Running-Ensemble-Models-on-Microcontrollers-using-TinyML
Based on this technique we showcase one usecase in the endless possibilities of this method : Developed a gas sensor detection system using an Ensemble Random Forest model on an Arduino R3 microcontroller, demonstrating the feasibility of running heavy ensemble models on resource-constrained devices with TinyML optimization.
